VERSION[0.1.0][18/01/2025]

Hello Exiles,

The Path of Building Community Team is happy to release the first version of Path of Building for Path of Exile 2

It was a lot  of work and there are sure to be an above-average number of bugs as many systems and interactions have
changed from PoE1 to PoE2.
At release of PoE2 Early Access a subset of the PoBCommunity team dug in and got to work carving
data/memory/assets/their-time like nobody's business in an effort to get this port put together.
It took us much longer than we anticipated (partially because many of us - to this day - highly enjoy playing PoE2 
and coding takes a back seat on some days; partially because it was Holiday Season; and partially because GGG did
not provide us with a Passive Skill Tree and the assets we normally have, so we had to go dig them up).

Huge thanks to: LocalIdentity, Nostrademous, trompetin17, TPlant, sida-wang, Peechey,
                QuickStick123, deathbeam, Helyos96, zao, Wires77

In this version we are releasing the following initial features:
* PoE2 Passive Skill Tree and support for "most" Ascendancies (including Weapon Set Skill Points)
* Support for Attribute Switching on small passive tree nodes
* Basic support for most Skills and Supports gems with Stat Sets breakdowns for skills with multiple parts or effects
* Support for many (possibly all) known unique items
* Re-coded ailment calculations formula
* Much improved skill tree rendering engine
* Rune & Soul Core support
* Spirit and Spirit Reservation
* First-pass of an updated Configuration pane



A quick hit-list of things that ^1ARE NOT SUPPORTED ^7in this initial release:

* Character Importing - GGG has not yet enabled the API that will allow us to import characters
* Meta Skills / Trigger Skills damage calculation - this needs an entire overhaul we didn't have time to do thus far
* Skill Combos - it is our hope in the future to implement the concepts of "rotations" in a given skill
        i.e. the rotation of holding down the skill button in game, each one has slightly different speed, modifiers,
        and damage potential
        (e.g., Tempest Flurry: normal strike -> normal strike -> third strike -> final strike)     
* Weapon Set Swap combos
* Support for all Nodes / Modifiers / Ascendancies
        Many are supported, but not all - if a modifier on an item, tree node or ascendancy node is 'blue coloured' 
        we parse it - and hopefully support it - if it's 'red coloured' we do not.
* Proper support for Skills granted by Items
        We still need to complete the process of fully removing the concept of
        skill gems being tied to item sockets that was in PoE1 to allow for this, we just ran out of time
* Map Mods
* Boss Skills
