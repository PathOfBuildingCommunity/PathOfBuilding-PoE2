-- Misbehaving software (think VPNs, anything network-related, even OS services) will occasionally attempt to connect
-- to newly-opened sockets for one reason or another. Previously, PoB only waited for one connection, and gave up
-- immediately if something went wrong.
--
-- This would result in a sequence of events roughly like this:
--   1. PoB opens a socket
--   2. A misbehaving piece of software connects to the socket, sends nothing, then terminates the connection
--   3. PoB tries to read from the socket, receives an error since the connection is terminated, and closes the server
--   4. OAuth authorization succeeds, but by the time the user is redirected back to PoB, the server is already closed
--   5. PoB never receives the OAuth redirect, and doesn't have any of the information necessary to use the API
--
-- To avoid this, we instead allow for any number of incoming connections, and simply stop listening for them once
-- either a) 30 seconds have elapsed or b) we've received a legitimate HTTP request and responded to it.
--
-- Unfortunately, this still isn't perfect: in theory, two applications (such as a browser, and something else) could
-- attempt to establish a connection at the same time. In the future, this could be refactored to perform non-blocking
-- IO, so that it can operate concurrently, but hopefully that isn't necessary.
